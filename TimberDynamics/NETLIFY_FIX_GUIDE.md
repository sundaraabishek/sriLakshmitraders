# How to Fix "Page Not Found" Error on Netlify

## The Problem
Your Srilakhmi Traders website has a backend server, but Netlify is trying to serve it as a static website only. This causes "Page not found" errors.

## Quick Fix Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Render Instead (Recommended)

**Render supports full-stack apps better than Netlify:**

1. **Go to render.com** and sign up
2. **Create New Web Service**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Configure settings:**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Environment: `Node`
5. **Deploy** - Your site will work perfectly!

### Solution 2: Use Vercel (Also Great)

**Vercel handles Node.js apps well:**

1. **Go to vercel.com** and sign up
2. **New Project** → Import your repository
3. **Deploy** - Vercel auto-detects Node.js
4. **Your site will work immediately!**

### Solution 3: Fix Netlify (More Complex)

**If you want to stick with Netlify:**

1. **Deploy only the frontend** (static files)
2. **Use a separate backend service** like:
   - Railway for the backend
   - Render for the backend
   - Heroku for the backend
